ON THE PROTEIN HYDRATATION WATER

This repository was created for the data analysis done at the course of neutron spectroscopy of A. Paciaroni at the University of Perugia. 

The data store the information of the inelastic scattering of neutrons with wavelength of 5 Å from two samples, each at two different temperature, namely:
    sample 1 --> MBP + H2O						specimen 1 --> MBP + H2O at 297 K
    sample 2 --> MBP + H2O			----\		specimen 2 --> MBP + H2O at 150 K
    temperature 1 --> 297 K 		----/		specimen 3 --> MBP + D2O at 297 K
    temperature 2 --> 150 K						specimen 4 --> MBP + D2O at 150 K
where MBP stay for Maltose Binding Protein.

The analysis was made with LAMP to get, from the measures of inelastic neutron scattering at IN5 of ILL, the vibrational density of the states of MBP hydratation water.
